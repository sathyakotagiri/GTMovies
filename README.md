# GTMovies - Summer 2016 Class Group Project

## What is this project?
###### This is a web based online movie ticketing system. A user can sign-up, browse through the currently playing movies, select a theater, and checkout. A user can also save preferred credit cards, preferred theaters so that the next time they checkout, these preferences will show up at the end. A user can also leave reviews and rating for a movie. Apart from a normal user, there is a manager role. A manager is able to add, delete movies and theaters. See the revenue for the past three months. See which movie is the most popular one, etc.
